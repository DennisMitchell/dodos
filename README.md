# Dodos Only Divide Or Surrender

*Dodos* is a programming language based on the *Divide Or Surrender* paradigm.

Given any problem, a Dodos program tries to recursively break it down into smaller subproblems. If and when that is no longer possible, it surrenders (backs out).

As a consequence, Dodos will find a solution to *any* problem, although it might not be *the* solution.
